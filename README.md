# EDA Assignment: Superstore
EDA Assignment: Superstore is a data analysis project that focuses on exploring and understanding a superstore sales dataset to extract meaningful insights and trends. The main objective of this project is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to analyze sales, profit, customer behavior, and product performance, providing actionable insights for business decision-making.

The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, which involves handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and standardizing column names. This step ensures that the dataset is ready for analysis and prevents errors during visualization and interpretation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. The analysis includes:

Sales and profit trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly)

Performance comparison across regions, categories, and sub-categories

Identifying top-performing products and customers

Examining relationships between sales, profit, discounts, and shipping modes

Detecting outliers, anomalies, and unusual patterns

Visualization plays a key role in this project. Charts, graphs, and plots such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps are used to communicate insights effectively. These visualizations help in understanding the data distribution, identifying correlations, and making strategic business decisions.

The repository includes Python notebooks and scripts documenting the entire workflow, including preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps. Users can modify the code to explore different metrics, apply additional visualizations, or perform deeper statistical analysis.

Overall, EDA Assignment: Superstore demonstrates how data analysis techniques can turn raw sales data into meaningful insights. It provides a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance, making it a valuable project for anyone learning data analysis, business analytics, or preparing for real-world data-driven decision-making.
